Expedia technical exercise
============


Language of choice
============

I've picked nodejs to do this exercise because I've recently been very interested in it because of its async capabilities.
Also, I only recently started using it in my current job so I thought it would be benefitial to use it to create something from scratch.

I also saw a chance to try one of the js templeting engines and picked handlebars because it seemed unbloated and straight forward


What I wanted to accomplish
============

Wanted to make the app as minimal as possible but for it to be robust and functional, also wanted to 
write the code in away that is easy to read and test.


What I learned
============
    * How to set up CI with travis and heroku
    * Jest is my favourite testing framework so far.
    * Handlebars turned out to be fun to work with.


Experience with used tech.
============

    * Node/express: about 3 months of working experience now.
    * Handlebars: first time using it.
    * heroku: first time working with it.
    * travis-ci: frist time working with it.
